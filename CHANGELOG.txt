2011-08-19 --- 3.0:
	- Plugin-extensible command line interface.
	- The 'view', 'sort', and 'index' command line plugins. These supersede the
	  fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMReader and
	  fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMSort classes, which have much less
	  functionality than the new plugins and are considered deprecated.
	- Embedded Picard SAM-JDK parts updated from version 1.27 to 1.47.
	- A compatible Picard SAM-JDK JAR, currently sam-1.47.jar, is now
	  distributed together with Hadoop-BAM.

2011-06-01 --- 2.0:
	- Heuristic splitting of BAM and BGZF files: indexing is no longer required.
	- build.xml now defaults to making a .jar file, no need for explicit 'ant
	  jar'.

2010-12-10 --- 1.0:
	- Initial release.
