2011-12-07 --- 3.2:
	- Important bug fix to avoid looping infinitely on some BAM files.

2011-12-05 --- 3.1:
	- Important data loss bug fixes!

	- 'sort' plugin updated to 2.0: it can now take multiple input files,
	  merging them together.

	- New 'summary' and 'summarysort' command line plugins, respectively for
	  creating and sorting Chipster summary files. Not very generically useful;
	  intended more as example code.

	- Some minor command line argument handling bug fixes.

	- Updated embedded and provided Picard from 1.47 to 1.56.

	- As Hadoop-BAM now depends on Picard proper as well as the SAM-JDK, a
	  compatible JAR, currently picard-1.56.jar, is distributed together with
	  Hadoop-BAM.

2011-08-19 --- 3.0:
	- Plugin-extensible command line interface.
	- The 'view', 'sort', and 'index' command line plugins. These supersede the
	  fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMReader and
	  fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMSort classes, which have much less
	  functionality than the new plugins and are considered deprecated.
	- Embedded Picard SAM-JDK parts updated from version 1.27 to 1.47.
	- A compatible Picard SAM-JDK JAR, currently sam-1.47.jar, is now
	  distributed together with Hadoop-BAM.

2011-06-01 --- 2.0:
	- Heuristic splitting of BAM and BGZF files: indexing is no longer required.
	- build.xml now defaults to making a .jar file, no need for explicit 'ant
	  jar'.

2010-12-10 --- 1.0:
	- Initial release.
