git master --- probably 5.1:
   - Removed the fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMReader and
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMSort classes, which were deprecated
     back in 3.0.

   - The command line plugins 'sort', 'summarize', and 'summarysort' now
     default to 1 reduce task. The amount can be customized with the
     -r/--reducers command line argument. This bumps up the versions of the
     plugins to 4.0, 3.0, and 2.0 respectively.

   - BAMRecordReader.getKey now hashes unmapped keys instead of randomizing
     them, to ensure consistent results.

   - For compatibility with Hadoop 2.0 and any future Hadoop releases, custom
     Hadoop classes are now only built and used when using a Hadoop release
     that does not provide them. This means that bugs MAPREDUCE-1987 and
     MAPREDUCE-2538, which were previously fixed internally, may cause problems
     when using the MapReduce-using command line plugins with certain reducer
     counts.

2012-08-31 --- 5.0:
   - MAJOR CHANGE: Hadoop-BAM no longer depends on, or even provides,
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom.samtools. In other words, users should now
     import Picard classes from Picard itself, i.e. net.sf.samtools.

   - Fix data loss/duplication and crash-on-valid issues in SAM input.

   - Fix FASTQ record writer to also write the flow cell ID and to emit null
     fields correctly.

   - Fix crash on some inputs caused by a bug in
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom.hadoop.InputSampler. (Not the same bug as was
     fixed in 4.0.)

   - Updated provided Picard from 1.56 to 1.76.

   - BAMRecordReader.getKey now randomizes the order of unmapped reads instead
     of giving them all the same key, improving performance since they can now
     be sent to different reduce tasks.

   - AnySAMInputFormat now has a nullary constructor, allowing it to be used
     directly in Job.setInputFormatClass.

   - FASTQ and QSEQ input formats now report isSplitable correctly for
     compressed files.

   - QSEQ output format and record writer now use a Text instead of a
     NullWritable key.

2012-05-03 --- 4.0:
   - SAM input and output support. AnySAMInputFormat handles transparent
     support of both SAM and BAM inputs even in the same Hadoop job. For
     output, there is no SAMOutputFormat; only AnySAMOutputFormat, which can be
     used to output either SAM or BAM. BAMOutputFormat will be deprecated in
     the future.

   - Fix longstanding regression in the embedded Picard library causing
     end-of-file markers to be written into BAM files by every reduce task. For
     this reason e.g. 'samtools view' refused to show the contents of BAM files
     output by Hadoop-BAM.

   - Fix crash on some inputs caused by a bug in
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom.hadoop.InputSampler.

   - Fix possible crash-on-valid situations in heuristic BAM splitting.

   - Various I/O classes from the Seal project are now incorporated. This
     includes input formats for FASTQ and QSEQ and an output format for QSEQ.
     Thanks to Luca Pireddu!

   - Unmapped reads are now ordered after, not before, all other reads.

   - Allow using Hadoop's "-libjars" command line argument instead of
     HADOOP_CLASSPATH to specify the Picard .jars. This ended up being
     fiendishly complicated and somewhat fragile.

   - Partitioning files are now saved in the output, not input, directory.

   - 'sort' plugin version 3.0:

     * Important bug fix for merging: conflicting IDs from different files
       weren't being properly corrected.
     * SAM input and output support. Can input SAM and BAM files at the same
       time and output to either format.
     * When not using -o, each reducer now outputs headers into the BAM files.

   - 'view' plugin version 1.1, with SAM input support.

   - Add new 'cat' plugin version 1.0, for concatenating SAM/BAM files. The
     main intended use case is joining the output of 'sort' when it is used
     without -o.

   - 'summarize' plugin version 2.0, with SAM input support.

   - SplittingBAMIndexer can now be used from within the library as well as a
     command line tool and can index files directly in HDFS. Thanks to Thomas
     Robinson!

   - Various minor bug fixes.
   - Lots of documentation updates.
   - Various clarifications in the README.
   - Much quieter error messages when plugin loading fails.

   - build.xml now looks in the HADOOP_HOME environment variable for Hadoop
     .jars. As a result, the required minimum version of Ant is now 1.7.1.
   - fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom is now compiled with warnings off, for less
     noisy builds.

2012-01-18 --- 3.3:
   - Fix embedded Picard to not have an accidentally leftover dependency on
     Picard 1.47.

   - Clarify some .jar dependencies in the README.

2011-12-07 --- 3.2:
   - Important bug fix to avoid looping infinitely on some BAM files.

2011-12-05 --- 3.1:
   - Important data loss bug fixes!

   - 'sort' plugin updated to 2.0: it can now take multiple input files,
     merging them together.

   - New 'summary' and 'summarysort' command line plugins, respectively for
     creating and sorting Chipster summary files. Not very generically useful;
     intended more as example code.

   - Some minor command line argument handling bug fixes.

   - Updated embedded and provided Picard from 1.47 to 1.56.

   - As Hadoop-BAM now depends on Picard proper as well as the SAM-JDK, a
     compatible JAR, currently picard-1.56.jar, is distributed together with
     Hadoop-BAM.

2011-08-19 --- 3.0:
   - Plugin-extensible command line interface.
   - The 'view', 'sort', and 'index' command line plugins. These supersede the
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMReader and
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMSort classes, which have much less
     functionality than the new plugins and are considered deprecated.
   - Embedded Picard SAM-JDK parts updated from version 1.27 to 1.47.
   - A compatible Picard SAM-JDK JAR, currently sam-1.47.jar, is now
     distributed together with Hadoop-BAM.

2011-06-01 --- 2.0:
   - Heuristic splitting of BAM and BGZF files: indexing is no longer required.
   - build.xml now defaults to making a .jar file, no need for explicit 'ant
     jar'.

2010-12-10 --- 1.0:
   - Initial release.
