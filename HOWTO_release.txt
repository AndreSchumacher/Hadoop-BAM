While we are not using maven-release, this is how to make a release.
Note: it is important to do these steps in exactly this order.

1. inside local clone of repo prepare the sourceforge git repo:

- update CHANGELOG.txt
- update scripts/create_repo.sh and scripts/create_dependency_repo.sh
  (if there was an update in dependencies)
- mvn clean
- mvn release:prepare
  _IMPORTANT_ choose version X.Y as the release tag name

2. prepare the release tarball:

- check out the release tag into separate directory called hadoop-bam-X.Y
- mvn package
- copy target/hadoop-bam-X.Y.jar and *-with-dependencies.jar into root
  directory, then delete target, scripts/, other files such as .git
- create tarball hadoop-bam-X.Y.tar.gz and upload tar.gz and README.txt to
  sourceforge (make sure to press "i" on file and select "all OS" so that
  it appears under the latest release link)

3. update the maven repo on sourceforge website:

- run scripts/create_repo.sh (and scripts/create_dependency_repo.sh if
  necessary)
- these will create files inside /tmp (a local maven repo)
- sftp local maven repo to sourceforge, path on ftp server:
  /home/project-web/hadoop-bam/htdocs/maven
  _Note_: you may need to manually delete old directories, such as
  6.2-SNAPSHOT after uploading 6.2 release
