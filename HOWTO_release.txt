While we are not using maven-release, this is how to make a release:
- update CHANGELOG.txt
- update scripts/create_repo.sh and scripts/create_dependency_repo.sh
  (if there was an update in dependencies)
- mvn clean
- mvn release:prepare
- run scripts/create_repo.sh (and scripts/create_dependency_repo.sh if
  necessary)
- sftp local maven repo to sourceforge:
  /home/project-web/hadoop-bam/htdocs/maven
- clean temporary files, create tarball and upload tar.gz and README.txt
  to sourceforge
